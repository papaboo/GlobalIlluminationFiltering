Log loss and metrics
* Can we log to the console in validation_step?
New and exciting networks :)
If the loss depends on the pixel intensity (fx MSE), then rescale the loss by that intensity, such that highlights and dark regions contribute equally, or make exposure great again. :)
Extend/weight loss to focus on border regions
Analyse which feature vectors are the most important by
* looking at the derivatives.
* Train networks with a single feature vector.
* Train networks with all but a single feature vector
