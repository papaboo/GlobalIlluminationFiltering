# Global Illumination Filtering

Filtering global illumination images created with path tracing. Inspired by the work in [Real-time Monte Carlo Denoising with the Neural Bilateral Grid](https://sites.google.com/view/bilateral-grid-denoising).

The dataset is from [Blockwise Multi-Order Feature Regression for Real-Time Path Tracing Reconstruction](http://www.tut.fi/vga/publications/Blockwise_Multi-Order_Feature_Regression_for_Real-Time_Path_Tracing_Reconstruction.html) and can be found [here](https://etsin.fairdata.fi/dataset/0ab24b68-4658-4259-9f1d-3150be898c63/data). The dataset should be downloaded and extracted to a Dataset folder in the root of the repository.
